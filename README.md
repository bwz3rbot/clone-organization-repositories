Thanks for using Clone Organization Repositories!

I know there are many tools to solve this problem, but all I've found are bash
files. I just understand node.js better and I figured that others might feel the
same.

Configuration is simple. Just make sure you're logged into the github cli (which
you probably already are), npm install packages and update the .env file with
your api key and org name and npm start to run.
